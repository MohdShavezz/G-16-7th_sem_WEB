Assignment Title: Interactive User List App (DOM + Async Programming)

Objective:
Understand and apply DOM manipulation techniques.
Work with asynchronous operations using fetch, Promises, and async/await.
Build a small application that interacts with an external API.

Assignment Requirements:
Part 1: Setup the UI
Create an HTML page with the following structure:
An input field to enter a user ID.
A button labeled "Get User".
A section to display the userâ€™s data:

Name
Email
Phone
Website
A loading indicator (like "Loading...").
Add basic styling using CSS.

Part 2: DOM Manipulation
Use JavaScript to:
Add event listeners to the button.
Validate the user ID input (must be a number between 1 and 10).
Show/hide the loading indicator.
Display fetched user data dynamically on the page.

Part 3: Async Programming
Fetch user data from this fake API:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{id}
Use both:

Part 4: Bonus (Optional)
Add a button: "Show All Users"
Fetch and display all users in a list (using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
Use setTimeout() to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before showing the data.
